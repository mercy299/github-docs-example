# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown makes it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share**  code. A good Cloud Engineer uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

# Simple span in a div
        <div class="hamburger" @click="toggleDiv">
            <span class="bar"></span>
            <span class="bar"></span>
            <span class="bar"></span>
        </div>
